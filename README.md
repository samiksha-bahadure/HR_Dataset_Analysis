# HR_Dataset_Analysis
This project is a Python-based HR Analytics simulation built inside a Jupyter Notebook. It allows users to explore employee data, perform data cleaning, generate insights, and visualize workforce trends. The project also demonstrates HR metrics such as salary distribution, department composition, and performance reviews. It can be extended into a full HR dashboard or predictive model.

✨ Features

Load and clean HR dataset (HRDatasets.csv)

Handle missing values and format dates (Hire Date, DOB, Termination Date, etc.)

Explore employee demographics (gender, age, marital status)

Department & position distribution analysis

Salary statistics and pay trends

Performance review tracking

Manager & reporting structure insights

Visualization of workforce metrics

📂 Dataset / Data Handling

Employee details stored in structured CSV format

Includes demographics, department, salary, and review data

Data cleaning includes:

Converting salary to numeric

Converting dates to datetime

Handling missing/null values

Flexible to extend with new employee records or external data sources

🔄 Project Workflow

Start the notebook → Load the HRDataset.ipynb file in Jupyter

Run the cells → Import dataset & clean data

Explore → View employee demographics, salary stats, and department data

Visualize → Generate charts for workforce trends

Analyze → Compute HR metrics like total employees, salary distribution, performance review dates

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python 3 (core language)

Jupyter Notebook (development environment)

Pandas / NumPy (data cleaning & handling)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (visualization & plotting)

💡 Use Cases
